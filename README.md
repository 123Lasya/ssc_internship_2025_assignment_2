The Student Service Community (SSC) website is a responsive web application built to serve as a central platform for students to explore educational resources, technical guidance, and social initiatives. It includes a clean homepage that showcases SSCâ€™s mission and vision, sections like educational services, tech events, and community initiatives, and pages where students can join SSC or explore available services. This project is part of an internship assignment to demonstrate frontend development using React.js, focusing on routing, component structure, and user experience.
